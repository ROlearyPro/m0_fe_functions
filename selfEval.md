# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I feel like the thing I'm happiest about is including a while loop for the shift() method, just because I could.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
- Functions are a powerful tool because they allow you to easily do tasks that could produce multiple different results depending on the input. Additionally, it reduces the amount of code that needs to be written since it doesn't need to be rewritten each time it's used, greatly simplifying things visually.
